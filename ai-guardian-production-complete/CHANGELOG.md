## Version 4.0.0 (Completed)

### Phase 1: Full Containerization & Deployment Cleanup

This phase focused on modernizing the deployment architecture to be secure, reproducible, and based on best practices using Docker.

#### Key Accomplishments:

1. **Full Application Containerization:**
   - **Backend Services:** Created optimized, multi-stage `Dockerfile`s for all 11 Python-based microservices
   - **Frontend Service:** Created a multi-stage `Dockerfile` for the `web-dashboard` using Node.js/pnpm for the build stage and Nginx for efficient static asset serving

2. **Unified & Secure Deployment Configuration:**
   - **Centralized Docker Compose:** Replaced the dynamically generated compose file with a single, authoritative `docker-compose.yml`
   - **Environment-Based Secrets:** Eliminated all hardcoded secrets and configurations
   - **Production-Safe Compose:** Uses pre-built images by default and removes insecure build contexts

3. **Streamlined Deployment Script:**
   - **Refactored `production-deploy.sh`:** Completely overhauled the main deployment script
   - **Docker-Native Orchestration:** The script is now a lean, safe wrapper that exclusively uses `docker-compose`

### Phase 2: Unify Development & Production Environments

1. **Development Environment Parity:**
   - **Introduced `docker-compose.override.yml`:** Created a development-specific override file
   - This approach ensures developers work in an environment identical to production

2. **Modernized Development Setup Script:**
   - **Refactored `setup.sh`:** Transformed from a complex, host-dependent provisioner into a simple, guiding script

### [2.1.0] - 2024-07-22 - "Database & Dependency Hardening"

- **Backend Dependency Audit**: Consolidated and audited all Python dependencies, resolved security vulnerabilities
- **Database Migration Implementation**: Replaced unsafe `db.create_all()` with production-grade migration system
