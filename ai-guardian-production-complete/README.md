# AI Guardian Enhanced - Production Ready v4.0.0

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the AI Guardian Enhanced v4.0.0 project, which has been fully containerized and prepared for production deployment.

## üöÄ Unified Docker-Based Deployment

The entire AI Guardian platform, including all backend microservices and the frontend dashboard, now runs within a unified Docker environment orchestrated by Docker Compose. This ensures consistency between development, testing, and production.

### Prerequisites
- Docker
- Docker Compose v2 (i.e., the `docker compose` command)

### 1. First-Time Environment Setup

If you are setting up this project for the first time, run the interactive setup script. It will check for prerequisites and create your initial `.env` file from the example.

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```
**IMPORTANT**: After running the setup, you must manually edit the newly created `.env` file to add your required secrets (database passwords, API keys, etc.).

### 2. Starting the Platform

To start the entire platform in detached mode, use the standard Docker Compose command:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```
The platform will be available at the following endpoints:
- **Web Dashboard**: `http://localhost:3000`
- **API Gateway**: `http://localhost:8000`
- **Grafana (Monitoring)**: `http://localhost:3001`
- **Prometheus (Monitoring)**: `http://localhost:9090`

### 3. Stopping the Platform

To stop all running services, use:
```bash
docker compose down
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The platform is a collection of containerized microservices that communicate over a Docker network. This approach ensures scalability and separation of concerns.

### Services
- **`api-gateway`**: The single entry point for all frontend requests. It routes traffic to the appropriate backend service.
- **`code-scanner`**: The core static analysis engine.
- **`adaptive-learning`**: Manages machine learning model training and updates.
- **`advanced-ml-service`**: Provides advanced AI/ML models for sophisticated threat detection.
- **`blockchain-security`**: Analyzes smart contracts and blockchain-related assets.
- **`cloud-security-service`**: Scans and monitors cloud provider configurations (AWS, GCP, Azure).
- **`communications-service`**: Handles all external communications like Slack, Teams, and Jira.
- **`integrations-service`**: Manages integrations with third-party tools like SIEMs.
- **`iot-mobile-security-service`**: Scans IoT devices and mobile applications.
- **`remediation-engine`**: Provides automated and suggested fixes for detected vulnerabilities.
- **`intelligent-analysis`**: A service for deeper, more complex analysis tasks.
- **`web-dashboard`**: The React-based frontend application.
- **`postgres`**: The central PostgreSQL database for all services.
- **`redis`**: In-memory cache for performance.
- **`prometheus` / `grafana`**: The monitoring and metrics stack.

### Database Migrations
Database schema migrations are handled automatically by `Flask-Migrate`. When a service's container starts, it will automatically apply any pending migrations to the central `postgres` database before launching the application server.

## üíª Development Workflow

For local development, the `docker-compose.override.yml` file is configured to:
- Mount local source code directories into the running containers.
- Enable hot-reloading for the Python Flask services.

This means you can edit code on your local machine and the changes will be reflected inside the container instantly, without needing to rebuild the image.

To start the stack in development mode, simply run the same `up` command:
```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```
Docker Compose automatically picks up the override file.

---

## üî¨ Testing

A robust, self-contained integration test suite is included. The test runner script handles starting the services, waiting for them to be healthy, running the tests, and cleaning up the environment automatically.

To run all integration tests:

```bash
chmod +x run_tests.sh
./run_tests.sh
```

The script will print the final status and save a detailed log to `test_results.log`.
